# 🚀 DevOps & Linux Practice Tasks

A repo where I dump everything I learn — daily tasks, teacher-assigned work, and my own grind.
Basically my **“I’m leveling up”** zone.

## 🌟 What’s Inside?

This repo is my running log of all the topics I learn across DevOps, Linux, AWS, and other tools.
Every task is added in order — clean, structured, no chaos (at least here 😂).

You’ll find:

* 🔹 **Daily learning tasks**
* 🔹 **Teacher-assigned exercises**
* 🔹 **Hands-on practicals**
* 🔹 **Notes + explanations**
* 🔹 **Commands, configs & screenshots placeholders**
* 🔹 **Mini-projects / labs**
